# My Hyprland Ricing

Welcome to my ricing project! This is a customized Hyprland environment based on the work of [JaKooLit](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Ubuntu-Hyprland/tree/24.04). My goal was to modify and enhance the configuration to fit the HTB style while maintaining functionality and performance.

## Description

This ricing is designed to provide an aesthetically pleasing and efficient user experience on Linux using Hyprland. I have incorporated a variety of customizations and tools that make my environment more attractive and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Custom Visual Style**: Changes in color themes, fonts, and visual elements.
- **Customizable Status Bar**: Uses [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) to display useful information such as time, CPU usage, memory, and more.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Configurations for [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) to achieve blur and transparency effects.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Customized shortcuts to improve productivity and navigation.
- **Terminal Configuration**: Customizations in the terminal using [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidguy/kitty) for a better command-line experience.
- **Window Management**: Modifications in window management for a more looking workflow.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- Hyprland
- Polybar
- Picom
- Kitty
